          <p>My name Andrew Oh and I am an aspiring Junior Backend Developer, currently undergoing a software development bootcamp. I have primarily been working with international hotel groups providing a wide range of exposure, a lifestyle SME and most recently my family start up. My varied experiences have provided me with an understanding of business functions ranging from customer service, sales, human resources, strategy and operations. In addition, my 12 years living overseas were spent in 5 countries and throughout these experiences I have learnt the importance of communication, adaptability, self-awareness and problem solving while integrating teamwork and leadership. </p>
          <p>One of the my most memorable work experiences was at Raffles Hotel Singapore. The unexpected arrival of 16 additional guests during a night shift while the hotel was fully booked, was initially a terrifying experience. I only had a small team on duty with me to problem solve this challenge. I learnt so much about lateral thinking, adaptability, teamwork, decisiveness, communication and customer service. As a result, I believe my actions combined with other instances led me to receiving the Raffles Hotel Employee of the Year award.
            I am confident that I will provide value to you, your customers and colleagues. I am excited about your company values and mission statement for staff and customers which aligns with my own. I believe this alignment strongly supports my candidacy for this role.
            Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to speaking with you about this employment opportunity.</p>
          <p>Sincerely,</p>
          <p>Andrew Oh</p>
